bool
====

Boolean built-in type.

Description
-----------

Boolean is a built-in type. It can represent any data type that is either a true or false value. You can think of it as an switch with on or off (1 or 0) setting. It's often used as part of programming logic in condition statements like ``if`` statements.

**Note:** In a code below ``if can_shoot`` is equivalent of ``if can_shoot == true``. It is good practice to follow the natural spoken language structure when possible. Use ``if can_shoot`` rather than ``if can_shoot == true`` and use ``if not can_shoot`` rather than ``if can_shoot == false``.

::

    var can_shoot = true
    
    func shoot():
        if can_shoot:
            # Perform shooting actions here.

The following code will only create a bullet if both conditions are met: action "shoot" is pressed and if ``can_shoot`` is ``true``.

**Note:** ``Input.is_action_pressed("shoot")`` is also a boolean that is ``true`` when "shoot" is pressed and ``false`` when "shoot" isn't pressed.

::

    var can_shoot = true
    
    func shoot():
        if can_shoot and Input.is_action_pressed("shoot"):
            create_bullet()

The following code will set ``can_shoot`` to ``false`` and start a timer. This will prevent player from shooting until the timer runs out. Next ``can_shoot`` will be set to ``true`` again allowing player to shoot once again.

::

    var can_shoot = true
    onready var cool_down = $CoolDownTimer
    
    func shoot():
        if can_shoot and Input.is_action_pressed("shoot"):
            create_bullet()
            can_shoot = false
            cool_down.start()
    
    func _on_CoolDownTimer_timeout():
        can_shoot = true

Method Descriptions
-------------------

.. _class_bool_method_bool:

- :ref:`bool<class_bool>` **bool** **(** :ref:`int<class_int>` from **)**

Cast an :ref:`int<class_int>` value to a boolean value, this method will return ``true`` if called with an integer value different to 0 and ``false`` in other case.

----

- :ref:`bool<class_bool>` **bool** **(** :ref:`float<class_float>` from **)**

Cast a :ref:`float<class_float>` value to a boolean value, this method will return ``true`` if called with a floating-point value different to 0 and ``false`` in other case.

----

- :ref:`bool<class_bool>` **bool** **(** :ref:`String<class_String>` from **)**

Cast a :ref:`String<class_String>` value to a boolean value, this method will return ``true`` if called with a non-empty string and ``false`` in other case. Examples: ``bool("False")`` returns ``true``, ``bool("")`` returns ``false``.
